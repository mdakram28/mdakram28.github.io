    "description": "I have been teaching ARM assembly to university students. This article is adapted from the tutorial material for a Computer Science Course - CPSC355 that I taught in 2022 and is meant to teach the basics of assembly, c and the inner working of a computer application. The article will focus on understanding how a computer program is written and how that program is understood and executed by the processor. We will write assemble for the 64-bit ARMv8 architecture CPU. We will also understand what the binary code of a program written in C looks like. We will run the program in a Linux OS.",
