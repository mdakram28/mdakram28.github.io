# GitHub profile optimization checklist

Use this alongside the **github-profile-README.md** in this repo to make your [github.com/mdakram28](https://github.com/mdakram28) profile stronger for visitors and recruiters.

---

## 1. Profile README (main impact)

- **Where it lives:** The README that shows on your profile comes from a repo named **exactly** `mdakram28` (same as your username), **not** from `mdakram28.github.io`.
- **What to do:** Copy the contents of **github-profile-README.md** into the `README.md` of your `mdakram28/mdakram28` repo. If that repo doesn’t exist, create a **new public** repo named `mdakram28`, add a `README.md`, and paste the content there.
- **Broken “Akram’s GitHub stats” image:** The new README uses the correct [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) URLs. If the image still fails (e.g. Vercel rate limits), see the comment in the README for self-hosting or the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/profile-readme-stats).

---

## 2. Profile settings (GitHub UI)

- **Bio:** Short and memorable is good. “Dreaming in code” works; you could also try something more specific, e.g.  
  `Software Engineer · Distributed systems & video streaming · C++ · Python · Rust`
- **Profile URL:** Keep **mdakram.com** and **LinkedIn** in the profile links so they match the README.

---

## 3. Pinned repositories

- Pin **4–6** repos that best show your skills (e.g. media-parser-gui, fastMp4Parser, istream-player).
- For each pinned repo:
  - Add a clear **description** in the repo settings (short sentence: what it does and why it’s interesting).
  - Use **topics** (e.g. `av1`, `hevc`, `video-streaming`, `cpp`, `typescript`, `research`) so the profile is discoverable.

---

## 4. Consistency and discoverability

- **README in each pinned repo:** A short README with problem, solution, and how to run/build helps visitors and recruiters.
- **Contributions:** Regular commits and PRs keep the contribution graph active and signal ongoing work.
- **Stars and forks:** Sharing projects (e.g. on LinkedIn, blog, mdakram.com) can drive traffic and stars.

---

## 5. Optional enhancements

- **Achievements:** You already have several; new ones will show automatically as you hit GitHub milestones.
- **Profile README:** You can add more sections later (e.g. “Currently learning”, “Blog”, “Talks”) as you grow.
